I've attempted to make a `github page` for a long time, but there are always something wrong with `jekyll`. At last, I found that the problem is `Windows`. When I change my OS into `Ubuntu`, all problems have gone.

It's worth mentioning that, `MathJax` display engine is used to render the mathematical formulas. For example \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(\alpha\\), \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), and the Fourier transform equations are shown as follows.
\\[
    \begin{align}
        F(\omega) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-i\omega t}\mathrm{d}t\text{,}\\\
        f(t) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)e^{i\omega t}\mathrm{d}\omega\text{.}
    \end{align}
\\]
